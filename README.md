The robustness this application computes for a given journey relies on the API data of BVG. As such, since building a data base with for a more convincing robustness score exceeds the scope of this project, our score relies on the current situation as reported by BVG and is explicitly not(!) based on a non-markovian stochastic model as would probably be appropriate. Still, the score gives a measure of robustness regardless of this fact.
